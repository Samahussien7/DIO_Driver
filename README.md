# DIO_Driver
AVR DIO Driver: Simplify digital pin management on Atmel AVR microcontrollers. Streamline interfacing with external components using this efficient library for digital input/output operations. Easily configure pins, toggle states, and implement GPIO functionality in your AVR projects.
#AVR DIO Driver
The AVR DIO Driver is a lightweight and efficient library designed for Atmel AVR microcontrollers to simplify the management of digital input and output pins. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer working on AVR projects, this driver aims to streamline the process of controlling GPIO pins, making it easier to interface with external components, sensors, and actuators.

# Features
Simple Interface: The driver provides a simple and intuitive API for setting and reading digital pins.
Flexible Configuration: Configure pins individually or in groups, specifying input/output, pull-up resistors, and more.
Efficient Performance: The driver is optimized for memory usage and execution speed, ensuring minimal impact on your application.
Example Usage: Included example code demonstrates how to initialize, configure, and use the DIO driver in your AVR projects.
Compatibility: This driver is designed to work with popular AVR microcontrollers and can be easily integrated into your projects.
Getting Started
To get started with the AVR DIO Driver, simply clone this repository and explore the example code provided. The code demonstrates how to initialize the driver, configure pins, and perform basic input/output operations. Feel free to adapt and extend the example for your specific project needs.


#include "dio.h"

int main(void) {
    // Initialize the DIO driver
    DIO_Init();
    
    // Configure Pin 13 as output
    DIO_SetPinDirection(DIO_PIN_13, DIO_OUTPUT);
    
    while (1) {
        // Toggle Pin 13
        DIO_TogglePin(DIO_PIN_13);
    }
}
